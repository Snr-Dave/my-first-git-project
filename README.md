# my-first-git-project
my first project to practice git commands 
## My Learning Journey with This Project

This project serves as my hands-on practice ground for Git and GitHub.
I'm learning about:
- Commits and version history
- Branching and merging (concepts)
- How to contribute to open source projects

I plan to add more details about specific features or learnings here soon!

Using GitHub's web interface is very convenient for mobile learning.
